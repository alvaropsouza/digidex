# Digidex v1.0
> This repository is the result of my javascript studying. Saw a Pokedex version made by Roger Melo and tought it was a good idea to engage on my own project to practice the concepts learned.

## Goals with this project
Better understanding of:
- Promises
- Fetch/catch functions
- Http requests
- CSS tricks
- General javascript using


Essentialy, this Digidex application is feeded by a digimon api, with 209 types of Digimon's. The app function is to get all oh those characters on screen and display it's type and name. Also put a digimon fandom link to each one of them, if the person wants to know more information about the digimon in question.
